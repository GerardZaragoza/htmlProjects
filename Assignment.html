<p>Here is a quote from Yahoo!life regarding Prince William and Kate Middleton about dogs:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://ca.style.yahoo.com/prince-william-makes-sweet-dogs-095500165.html">
	In an instagram video, Prince William and Kate middleton was seen outside of Windsor castle giving thanks the people for the well-wishes and support the people
	has been giving in this time of mourning. the pair was seen chatting with poeple when they saw a dog in the crowd. being dog lovers themselves they went up to the owner and asked the name of the dog
	and middleton petting the dog. Prince William greeted the dog and added "Doggies at this time are very important." The comment brought up a smile among the crowd.
